# Breast Cancer Classification :cancer:

#### This dataset is about Breast Cancer classification. Cancer is categorized into two categories: Malignant (M) and Benign (B)

+ The dataset contains 32 different types of variables and all of them are numerical variables.
+ We have target variable as ‘diagnosis’, which is 0 if diagnosis is ‘Benign’ and shows ‘1’ if the diagnosis is ‘Malignant’
+ Objective of this code is to build a classifier for accurately predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer.
+ I have employed Random forest, Support vector machine and Multilayer perceptron algorithms to build a classifier and also performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSeachCV to find optimal hyperparameter for out model.
+ Finally, I have also shown feature extraction method with 'Pearson's correlation coefficient' and 'LassoCV' method.
