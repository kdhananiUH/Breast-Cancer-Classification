# Breast Cancer Classification :cancer:

#### This dataset is about Breast Cancer classification. Cancer is categorized into two categories: Malignant (M) and Benign (B)

+ Objective of this code is to build a classifier for accurately predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer.
+ I have employed Random forest, Support vector machine and Multilayer perceptron algorithms to build a classifier and also performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSeachCV to find optimal hyperparameter for out model.
+ Finally, I have also shown feature extraction method with 'Pearson's correlation coefficient' and 'LassoCV' method.
